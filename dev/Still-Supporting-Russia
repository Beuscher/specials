# This is a list of Companies and Brands still doing business with Russia and earning lots of money. 
# There is an argument to be made, that by still doing business, they at least prolong the war against Ukraine.
# If you don't like it, you can import this list as a blocklist, as a form of boycott to these brands.
# If you like it, you can import this list as a whitelist, and be happy about it.
# Whatever you do with this list is up to you.
